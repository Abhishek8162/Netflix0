<h2>Dragon Ball Z</h2> 
<div> Dragon Ball Z follows the adventures of the adult Goku who, along with his companions,
    defends the earth against an assortment of villains ranging from intergalactic space fighters
     and conquerors, unnaturally powerful androids and near indestructible magical creatures. While
      the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku through childhood into adulthood, Dragon Ball Z
       is a continuation of his adulthood life, but at the same time parallels the maturation of 
       his son, Gohan, as well as other characters from Dragon Ball and more.
